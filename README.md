# KeepClone

A simple SwiftUI application that replicates the core features of Google Keep. This project serves as an experimental playground for exploring the latest advancements in SwiftUI, particularly the new navigation stack and SwiftUI Data.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete notes
- Different note colors
- Customizable list view
- Persistent data storage using SwiftUI Data

## Experimenting with SwiftUI Data

This project utilizes SwiftUI Data to manage the persistent storage of notes. SwiftUI Data provides a declarative way to manage data using a Combine-based data store. It offers several advantages, including:

- Real-time data updates across all views
- Easy integration with view state management
- Support for multiple data sources and backend integrations

## Navigating with the New Navigation Stack

The new navigation stack in SwiftUI introduces a more flexible and declarative approach to navigating between views. It provides a cleaner and more maintainable alternative to the previous navigation system. Key features include:

- Hierarchical navigation with nested views
- Customizable navigation bars with custom content
- Support for multiple navigation styles, including push, modal, and drawer
